## Evaluating and comparing Airbnb pricing for each borough in NY

### Purpose
I want to investigate the relationship between Airbnb price and borough in NY. I am using the [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

I wanted to answer two questions:

- How can price be broken down into categories? This will be helpful to summarize the data.
- How do price categories compare between the NY boroughs? In the dataset, a borough is called a "neighborhood group".

### Conclusion
- Budget-conscious travelers might prefer The Bronx
- The average tourist will likely gravitate toward Manhattan and Brooklyn, as there are many locations that are reasonably priced
- Travelers seeking more luxurious options will have the most luck in Manhattan
